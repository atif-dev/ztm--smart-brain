### Demonstration

The purpose of this project is to detect a face in a picture. If there is a face in a picture then face will be detected using a blue box. For face detection [Clarifai API](https://www.clarifai.com/) is used.
Let's talk about front end...We need to register first at https://ztm--smart-brain.herokuapp.com/. During registration at back-end in code registered user password will be hashed(Simply means I can't figure out what will be your password while interacting with database). After registration we have to perform following steps for face detection.
1. Google a face image
2. Copy image address/image link
3. Paste link in input field
4. Click/Touch Detect button
